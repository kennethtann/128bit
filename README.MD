# The Traveller

The Traveller, featuring a website and a telegram bot, is here to accompany you for the whole time, before you even pack your luggage.

* Website: Load by going to `Final Webpage/index.html`
* Telegram Bot: `the_traveller_telegram_bot_main.py`

Pre-travel: The Traveller's website helps you with setting your sights on where to go! Based on prompts, like the user's character type, budget, and duration of the trip, it then suggests potential destinations for the user to consider, complete with a detailed itinerary, as well as highlights like good food, deals and souvenirs!

On Holiday: Use the telegram bot _@the_traveller_bot_, ready to help you anytime, anywhere! Can't read a sign in another language? Simply snap a photo and The Traveller utilises OCR to extract the text from the image in order to translate it to English using Google Translate API. Reflect on each day of the trip by writing a journal at the end of the day to your assistant.

* As sensitive information may be provided by the user, a benefit of using Telegram is that chats and comunications are encrypted.

Back to reality: Shag? But fret not, relive your trip by viewing your complete journal on your exciting trip!
